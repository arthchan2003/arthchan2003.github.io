## Deep Learning

- **[Learning Deep Learning ‚Äì My Top Five List](learning-dl-top5.md)** - This is date back in 2017 and badly need an update. For example, LLM plays a more significant role in 2025, I still recommend you to learn up the fundamentals from the resources though. 
- **[Book List and Reviews](book-recommendations.md)**
