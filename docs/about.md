#Hi, I am Arthur Chan. Here is a short bio of mine :

I have been working on speech recognition-related problems for the last 15 years. I was a Staff Scientist at BBN, a Speech Scientist at Speechworks (later acquired by Nuance), a Core Technology Scientist at Scanscout (later acquired by Tremor Video).

While at CMU, I was one of the maintainers of the CMU Sphinx project. I mainly worked on Sphinx 3.X but later branched out on SphinxTrain.

I currently serve as a Principal Speech Architect at Voci Technology. My speciality is to maintain and further develop ASR-related software.  I also heavily involved in other machine learning tasks such as emotion classification, gender detection as well as keyword spotting.

This page is a revival of my old blog - [The Grand Janitor Blog](http://thegrandjanitor.com/about/) which is acollection of my thoughts on speech recognition, machine learning and technology-related issues.  Since 2016 April, I curated the [Facebook Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (AIDL) Forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/).
