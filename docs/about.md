# What's up? This is Arthur Chan.

Here’s a short bio of mine:

I have been working on speech recognition–related problems (lately rebranded as *Conversational AI*) for the last 25 years. I was a Staff Scientist at BBN, a Speech Scientist at SpeechWorks (later acquired by Nuance), a Core Technology Scientist at ScanScout (later acquired by Tremor Video), and a Principal Speech Architect at Voci (later acquired by Medallia).

### At CMU  
I was one of the maintainers of the CMU Sphinx project. I primarily worked on Sphinx 3.X, but later contributed to SphinxTrain as well.

### At Voci  
As Principal Speech Architect, my specialty was maintaining and extending ASR-related software. I was also deeply involved in machine learning tasks such as emotion classification, gender detection, and keyword spotting. I did hands-on coding and led a team of three colleagues.

### Independent AI Advisory
Currently, I’m an AI advisor in the space of Conversational AI — covering ASR, LLMs, and TTS.

Since April 2016, I’ve also curated the [Facebook Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (AIDL) Forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/) and its [LinkedIn version](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12846050/)
