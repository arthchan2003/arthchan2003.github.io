## üß† Core Machine Learning Books

### **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning**  
**Author**: Christopher Bishop  
- Widely referred to as **PRML**, this is one of the most comprehensive treatments of machine learning techniques such as neural networks, graphical models, and boosting.
- Strongly Bayesian in approach. Treats bias-variance as a ‚Äúfrequentist illusion.‚Äù
- Considered tough but highly rewarding. Especially insightful if you do the exercises.
- Not focused on deep learning; for that, see the Goodfellow/Bengio/Courville book.

### **Pattern Classification (3rd Edition)**  
**Authors**: R. Duda, P.E. Hart, D.G. Stork  
- Known informally as **Duda and Hart**.
- Terse and technical; originally the ‚Äúbible‚Äù of pattern classification.
- Slightly outdated but still valuable, especially in its treatment of linear classifiers.
- Includes updated computer exercises in the 3rd edition.

### **Machine Learning**  
**Author**: Tom Mitchell  
- More concise and beginner-friendly than PRML or Duda & Hart.
- Covers concept learning, decision trees, and neural networks.
- Highly readable and still insightful, though less aligned with modern deep learning practices.

### **The Master Algorithm**  
**Author**: Pedro Domingos  
- A popular science-style book offering a sweeping overview of ML philosophies.
- Great for understanding different schools of thought in ML.

## üìñ Books I've Heard Are Excellent

- *The Elements of Statistical Learning* ‚Äì Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman  
- *Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning* ‚Äì David Barber  
- *Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective* ‚Äì Kevin Murphy  
- *Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms* ‚Äì David MacKay  
- *Deep Learning* ‚Äì Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville  
  - The only book here directly focused on deep learning. [See my impression here.](http://thegrandjanitor.com/2017/01/21/deep-learning-book-goodfellow-et-al-quick-impression/)

## üß¨ Historical / Advanced References

- *Perceptrons: An Introduction to Computational Geometry* ‚Äì Marvin Minsky & Seymour Papert  
  - Historically significant; challenged early neural net developments.

- *Parallel Models of Associative Memory* ‚Äì Geoffrey Hinton  
  - Of historical interest and influence.
