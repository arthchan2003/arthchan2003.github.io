# AI Portfolio

For the most part, working on machine learning means creating programs that work in real life.  
In that regard, here are selected systems I've worked on over the years.  
**Noted work is bolded.** Not all work is shown — feel free to contact me if you have questions on specific AI/LLM/deep-learning-related problems.
